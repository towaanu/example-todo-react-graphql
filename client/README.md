# Client
## Docker
If you have docker installed, you can run :  
`./run.docker.sh`  
*Note: `run.docker.sh` need to be executable (`chmod +x run.docker.sh`)*   
 The script will start a nodejs container and give you an access to this container.  
 You can then run commands to start the app.

## Without docker
If you don't have docker installed, you need to have nodejs installed.  
Before running command, you need to be at the root of the todos folder (`cd ./todos`)

## Run the app
## Install depedencies
`npm install`
## Run the app
`npm start`   
*The app should be accessible at http://localhost:3000*
